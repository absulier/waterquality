#Problem:
-Water quality is a huge factor in public health, but unfortunately not
consistently clean everywhere in the US.

-Identify if particular groups are most at risk for certain contaminations or
violations in their drinking water.

-Try to predict where future drinking water violations will occur

##NOTE:
Full data set is too large to push to github.
To compile full data set:

1) In "EPA" directory, run 'vio_cat.py'  
2) In "census" directory, run 'census_cleaner.py'  
3) In main directory, run 'data_compile.py'  

These steps will print 3 CSV files to the local directory housing the git
repository of this project.
