#Problem:
-Water quality is a huge factor in public health, but unfortunately not consistently clean everywhere in the US.

-Identify if particular groups are most at risk for certain contaminations or violations in their drinking water.

-Try to predict where future drinking water violations will occur

##NOTE:
Full data set is too large to push to github in individual file. To compile full
data set, first run 'vio_cat.py' in the EPA directory and then run 'data_compile.py' in
main directory.
